# Quotes

### A simple page that display a different quote and different colors every day.

#### Stuff that I do here:
- Avoid use any framework or library. Only CSS pure and vanilla Javascript
- Responsive design (I'm starting to like CSS... just a little)
- Use ```fetch``` method to connect to an API to retrive the quote.
- CSS to design a nice (to my perspective hehe) view.
- Set random color for every time the page is reload.
